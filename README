Building Lazyux
===============

Although Lazyux can be built using any Linux distribution, it is actively tested
and developed against Debian 7 (Wheezy) and above.

In order to build Lazyux, first, install packages required for the building
process:
  apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev unzip flex \
  bison git nasm fontforge libfont-ttf-perl xorriso squashfs-tools pkg-config \
  librsvg2-bin

Then, build a bootable Lazyux image using the scripts:
  sh build_all.sh
  sh create_iso.sh
