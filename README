DSLR is a small, "live", 64-bit Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/)
distribution in the spirit of Damn Small Linux (http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/),
targeted at advanced users. It's a lightweight operating system that comes
pre-loaded with many useful applications and breaths new life into nostalgic
applications and old hardware.

DSLR revives classic applications like Ted (http://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/) 2.17 and
Dillo (http://www.dillo.org/) 0.8.6, by porting them so they run against today's
musl (http://www.musl-libc.org/) and Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) 3.x, on
x86_64. This blend of good, old applications, a recent base and 64-bit support
is unique to DSLR and makes it extremely fast.

DSLR's development follows the guidelines in the project manifest described in
MANIFEST.

Building
========

DSLR is built from source. It is cross-compiled through Ubuntu
(http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04 x86_64.

The whole process is automated; there's a script (http://goo.gl/8x9id4) that
generates a clean, up-to-date build environment, then cross-compiles the entire
DSLR inside it.

To build DSLR:
  wget http://goo.gl/8x9id4
  sudo sh 8x9id4 ./dslr-chroot
  sudo ls ./dslr-chroot/root/dslr/releases

The script should run on Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04 x86_64 as well.
It is highly recommended to read the script first, as it installs debootstrap on
the host.
