DSLR is a small, "live", 64-bit Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/)
distribution in the spirit of Damn Small Linux (http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/),
targeted at advanced users. It's a lightweight operating system that comes
pre-loaded with many useful applications and breaths new life into nostalgic
applications and old hardware.

DSLR revives classic applications like Ted (http://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/) 2.17 and
Dillo (http://www.dillo.org/) 0.8.6, by porting them so they run against today's
musl (http://www.musl-libc.org/) and Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) 3.x, on
x86_64. This blend of good, old applications, a recent base and 64-bit support
is unique to DSLR and makes it extremely fast.

Building
========

DSLR is built from source. It is cross-compiled through Ubuntu
(http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04 x86_64.

First, install required packages:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev \
  autoconf-archive unzip flex bison git nasm squashfs-tools pkg-config \
  file subversion bc xfonts-utils dosfstools mtools yasm libarchive-dev \
  libcurl4-gnutls-dev libsqlite3-dev xorriso wget \
  liblwp-useragent-determined-perl

Then, build and install packdude (https://github.com/dimkr/packdude):
  git clone https://github.com/dimkr/packdude.git
  cd packdude
  make
  sudo make install
  cd ..

Build a cross-compiler using musl-cross (https://github.com/dimkr/musl-cross):
  git clone https://github.com/dimkr/musl-cross.git
  cd musl-cross
  sudo ./build.sh
  cd ..

Build the entire DSLR package repository:
  git clone https://github.com/dimkr/dslr.git
  cd dslr
  make packages

Finally, generate a bootable DSLR image:
  make iso

It is possible to generate a DSLR image without building all its packages
first. In this case, packages will be downloaded from the official repository.
