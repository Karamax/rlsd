Lazyux is an ultra-minimalistic, no-frills, embedded-like distribution of
Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/) in its early stages of development.

About Lazyux
============

Features:
  - Small and extremely lightweight
  - Secure
  - Cross-compiled quickly
  - Statically-linked
  - Supports remote administration and headless systems
  - Familiar: Unix-like and written in C
  - Permissively-licensed

Current status:
  - Builds flawlessly for x86_64 on Debian 7 (http://www.debian.org/)
  - Boots under UEFI and automatically detects all hardware, using the kmoduled
    applet from lazy-utils (https://github.com/iguleder/lazy-utils)
  - All include applications work
  - Contains documentation for each package under /usr/share/doc and in man
    pages
  - At the moment, the kernel cannot be cross-compiled
  - Lacks network tools (i.e route, ifconfig) and a firewall
  - Lacks a script for the automated construction of a bootable media, which is
    a manual process at the moment
  - Lacks a persistent root file system
  - Lacks package management

Potantial uses:
  - A "live" operating system for private browsing, system rescue, etc'
  - Firmware for routers, firewalls and switches
  - A dedicated server operating system

Building Lazyux
===============

Although Lazyux can be built using any Linux distribution, it is actively tested
and developed against Debian 7 (Wheezy).

The following packages are required in order to build Lazyux in a clean Debian
environment:
  - pkg-config, alsa-lib uses it when it searches for ncurses
  - git and unzip, to build lazy-utils
  - flex and bison, to build UnNetHack
