Building Lazyux
===============

Although Lazyux can be built using any Linux distribution, it is actively tested
and developed against Debian 7 (Wheezy).

The following packages are required in order to build Lazyux in a clean Debian
environment:
  - git and unzip, to build lazy-utils
  - nasm, to build libjpeg-turbo
  - fontforge and libfont-ttf-perl, to build the DejaVu fonts

Once the required packages are installed, build a bootable Lazyux image using
the scripts:
  sh build_all.sh
  sh create_iso.sh

=============================

While the packages and patches included in Lazyux are licensed under various
licenses, Lazyux itself is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license, see COPYING
